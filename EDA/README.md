# NYC MTA Subway Demographic Analysis


The goal of this project was to use Exploratory Data Analysis to determine the demographic in 1-squre mile around the top 5 busiest station in New York in order to help our clients reach their marking targeted demographic. We worked with data provided by NYC Metropolitan Transportation Authority and The United States Census Bureau to obtain New York city Demographic Data, leveraging data cleaning along with graphs to meet our clients needs while also providing data to back up our findings. After concluding our analysis, We prepared a presentation and plotted our findings to highlight which station is the best fit for each of our clients.
